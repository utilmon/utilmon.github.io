id="introduction-what-is-portfolio-optimization">Introduction: What is portfolio optimization?</h2> <p>Portfolio optimization is a crucial process for anyone who wants to maximize returns from their investments. Investments are usually a collection of so-called assets (stock, credits, bonds, derivatives, calls, puts, etc..) and this collection of assets is called a <strong>portfolio</strong>.</p> <p>The goal of portfolio optimization is to minimize risks (financial loss) and maximize returns (financial gain). But this process is not as simple as it may seem. Gaining high returns with little risk is indeed too good to be true. Risks and returns usually have a trade-off relationship which makes optmizing your portfolio a little more complicated. As Dr. Harry Markowitz states in his Modern Portfolio Theory he created in 1952, “risk is an inherrent part of higher reward.”</p> <p><strong>Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)</strong> <br/> An investment theory based on the idea that investors are risk-averse, meaning that when given two portfolios that offer the same expected return they will prefer the less risky one. Investors can construct portfolios to maximize expected return based on a given level of market risk, emphasizing that risk is an inherent part of higher reward. It is one of the most important and influential economic theories dealing with finance and investment. Dr. Harry Markowitz created the modern portfolio theory (MPT) in 1952 and won the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences in 1990 for it. <br/><br/> <strong>Reference:</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory">Modern Portfolio Theory</a></p> <h2 id="1-finding-the-efficient-frontier">1. Finding the efficient frontier</h2> <p>The Modern portfolio theory (MPT) serves as a general framework to determine an ideal portfolio for investors. The MPT is also referred to as mean-variance portfolio theory because it assumes that any investor will choose the optimal portfolio from the set of portfolios that</p> <ul> <li>Maximizes expected return for a given level of risk; and</li> <li>Minimizes risks for a given level of expected returns.</li> </ul> <p>Consider a situation where you have two stocks to choose from: A and B. You can invest your entire wealth in one of these two stocks. Or you can invest 10% in A and 90% in B, or 20% in A and 80% in B, or 70% in A and 30% in B, etc … There is a huge number of possible combinations and this is a simple case when considering two stocks. Imagine the different combinations you have to consider when you have thousands of stocks.</p> <p>The minimum variance frontier shows the minimum variance that can be achieved for a given level of expected return. To construct a minimum-variance frontier of a portfolio:</p> <ul> <li>Use historical data to estimate the mean, variance of each individual stock in the portfolio, and the correlation of each pair of stocks.</li> <li>Use a computer program to find out the weights of all stocks that minimize the portfolio variance for each pre-specified expected return.</li> <li>Calculate the expected returns and variances for all the minimum variance portfolios determined in step 2 and then graph the two variables.</li> </ul> <p>Investors will never want to hold a portfolio below the minimum variance point. They will always get higher returns along the positively sloped part of the minimum-variance frontier. And the positively sloped part of the minimum-variance frontier is called the <strong>efficient frontier</strong>.</p> <p>The <strong>efficient frontier</strong> is where the optimal portfolios are. And it helps narrow down the different portfolios from which the investor may choose.</p> <h2 id="2-goal-of-our-exercise">2. Goal Of Our Exercise</h2> <p>The goal of this exercise is to find the efficent frontier for an inherent risk using a quantum approach. We will use Qiskit’s Finance application modules to convert our portfolio optimization problem into a quadratic program so we can then use variational quantum algorithms such as VQE and QAOA to solve our optimization problem. Let’s first start by looking at the actual problem we have at hand.</p> <h2 id="3-four-stock-portfolio-optimization-problem">3. Four-Stock Portfolio Optimization Problem</h2> <p>Let us consider a portfolio optimization problem where you have a total of four assets (e.g. STOCK0, STOCK1, STOCK2, STOCK3) to choose from. Your goal is to find out a combination of two assets that will minimize the tradeoff between risk and return which is the same as finding the efficient frontier for the given risk.</p> <h2 id="4-formulation">4. Formulation</h2> <p>How can we formulate this problem?<br/> The function which describes the efficient frontier can be formulated into a quadratic program with linear constraints as shown below. <br/> The terms that are marked in red are associated with risks and the terms in blue are associated with returns. You can see that our goal is to minimize the tradeoff between risk and return. In general, the function we want to optimize is called an objective function. <br/> <br/></p> \[\min_{x \in \{0, 1\}^n}: q x^n\Sigma x - \mu ^n x\] \[subject \ to: 1^n x = B\] <ul> <li> <font size="4em">x</font> <p>indicates asset allocation.</p> </li> <li> <font size="4em">Σ</font> <p>(sigma) is a covariance matrix. A covariance matrix is a useful math concept that is widely applied in financial engineering. It is a statistical measure of how two asset prices are varying with respect to each other. When the covariance between two stocks is high, it means that one stock experiences heavy price movements and is volatile if the price of the other stock changes.</p> </li> <li> <font size="4em">q</font> <p>is called a risk factor (risk tolerance), which is an evaluation of an individual’s willingness or ability to take risks. For example, when you use the automated financial advising services, the so-called robo-advising, you will usually see different risk tolerance levels. This q value is the same as such and takes a value between 0 and 1.</p> </li> <li> <font size="4em">𝝁</font> <p>(mu) is the expected return and is something we obviously want to maximize.</p> </li> <li> <font size="4em">n</font> <p>is the number of different assets we can choose from</p> </li> <li> <font size="4em">B</font> <p>stands for Budget. And budget in this context means the number of assets we can allocate in our portfolio.</p> </li> </ul> <h4 id="goal">Goal:</h4> <p>Our goal is to find the <strong>x</strong> value. The x value here indicates which asset to pick (𝑥[𝑖]=1) and which not to pick (𝑥[𝑖]=0).</p> <h4 id="assumptions">Assumptions:</h4> <p>We assume the following simplifications:</p> <ul> <li>all assets have the same price (normalized to 1),</li> <li>the full budget \(B\) has to be spent, i.e. one has to select exactly \(B\) assets.</li> <li>the equality constraint \(1^n x = B\) is mapped to a penalty term \((1^n x - B)^2\) which is scaled by a parameter and subtracted from the objective function.</li> </ul> <h2 id="step-1-import-necessary-libraries">Step 1.

For example, if you allocate twice for STOCK3 and one for STOCK2, then your portfolio can be represented as [2, 1, 0, 0]. If you allocate a single weight for STOCK0, STOCK1, STOCK2 then your portfolio will look like [0, 1, 1, 1].</p> <p>Furthermore, let’s change the constraint to B=3.

By default, bounds is set to ‘None’ which means all the variables are binary. But we can set bounds=[[0,2],[0,2],[0,2],[0,2]] to allow any one of the four stocks to have double weights.</li> <li>Repeat the stocks twice in the list and concatenate the expected return and covariance data. For example, you can allocate double weights to one asset by repeating them twice like [STOCKA, STOCKB, STOCKC, STOCKD, <strong>STOCKA</strong>, <strong>STOCKB</strong>, <strong>STOCKC</strong>, <strong>STOCKD</strong>]. This way, even with only binary variables, you can still allocate double weights.

In December, we launched our first natively multimodal model Gemini 1.0 in three sizes: Ultra, Pro and Nano. Just a few months later we released 1.5 Pro, with enhanced performance and a breakthrough long context window of 1 million tokens.Developers and enterprise customers have been putting 1.5 Pro to use in incredible ways and finding its long context window, multimodal reasoning capabilities and impressive overall performance incredibly useful.We know from user feedback that some applications need lower latency and a lower cost to serve. This inspired us to keep innovating, so today, we’re introducing Gemini 1.5 Flash: a model that’s lighter-weight than 1.5 Pro, and designed to be fast and efficient to serve at scale.Both 1.5 Pro and 1.5 Flash are available in public preview with a 1 million token context window in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. And now, 1.5 Pro is also available with a 2 million token context window via waitlist to developers using the API and to Google Cloud customers.We’re also introducing updates across the Gemini family of models, announcing our next generation of open models, Gemma 2, and sharing progress on the future of AI assistants, with Project Astra.Context lengths of leading foundation models compared with Gemini 1.5’s 2 million token capability1.5 Flash is the newest addition to the Gemini model family and the fastest Gemini model served in the API. It’s optimized for high-volume, high-frequency tasks at scale, is more cost-efficient to serve and features our breakthrough long context window.While it’s a lighter weight model than 1.5 Pro, it’s highly capable of multimodal reasoning across vast amounts of information and delivers impressive quality for its size.The new Gemini 1.5 Flash model is optimized for speed and efficiency, is highly capable of multimodal reasoning and features our breakthrough long context window.1.5 Flash excels at summarization, chat applications, image and video captioning, data extraction from long documents and tables, and more. This is because it’s been trained by 1.5 Pro through a process called “distillation,” where the most essential knowledge and skills from a larger model are transferred to a smaller, more efficient model.Read more about 1.5 Flash in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report, on the Gemini technology page, and learn about 1.5 Flash’s availability and pricing.Over the last few months, we’ve significantly improved 1.5 Pro, our best model for general performance across a wide range of tasks.Beyond extending its context window to 2 million tokens, we’ve enhanced its code generation, logical reasoning and planning, multi-turn conversation, and audio and image understanding through data and algorithmic advances. We see strong improvements on public and internal benchmarks for each of these tasks.1.5 Pro can now follow increasingly complex and nuanced instructions, including ones that specify product-level behavior involving role, format and style. We’ve improved control over the model’s responses for specific use cases, like crafting the persona and response style of a chat agent or automating workflows through multiple function calls. And we’ve enabled users to steer model behavior by setting system instructions.We added audio understanding in the Gemini API and Google AI Studio, so 1.5 Pro can now reason across image and audio for videos uploaded in Google AI Studio. And we’re now integrating 1.5 Pro into Google products, including Gemini Advanced and in Workspace apps.Read more about 1.5 Pro in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report and on the Gemini technology page.Gemini Nano is expanding beyond text-only inputs to include images as well. Starting with Pixel, applications using Gemini Nano with Multimodality will be able to understand the world the way people do — not just through text, but also through sight, sound and spoken language.Read more about Gemini 1.0 Nano on Android.Today, we’re also sharing a series of updates to Gemma, our family of open models built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models.We’re announcing Gemma 2, our next generation of open models for responsible AI innovation. Gemma 2 has a new architecture designed for breakthrough performance and efficiency, and will be available in new sizes.The Gemma family is also expanding with PaliGemma, our first vision-language model inspired by PaLI-3. And we’ve upgraded our Responsible Generative AI Toolkit with LLM Comparator for evaluating the quality of model responses.Read more on the Developer blog.As part of Google DeepMind’s mission to build AI responsibly to benefit humanity, we’ve always wanted to develop universal AI agents that can be helpful in everyday life. That’s why today, we’re sharing our progress in building the future of AI assistants with Project Astra (advanced seeing and talking responsive agent).To be truly useful, an agent needs to understand and respond to the complex and dynamic world just like people do — and take in and remember what it sees and hears to understand context and take action. It also needs to be proactive, teachable and personal, so users can talk to it naturally and without lag or delay.While we’ve made incredible progress developing AI systems that can understand multimodal information, getting response time down to something conversational is a difficult engineering challenge. Over the past few years, we’ve been working to improve how our models perceive, reason and converse to make the pace and quality of interaction feel more natural.Building on Gemini, we’ve developed prototype agents that can process information faster by continuously encoding video frames, combining the video and speech input into a timeline of events, and caching this information for efficient recall.By leveraging our leading speech models, we also enhanced how they sound, giving the agents a wider range of intonations. These agents can better understand the context they’re being used in, and respond quickly, in conversation.With technology like this, it’s easy to envision a future where people could have an expert AI assistant by their side, through a phone or glasses. And some of these capabilities are coming to Google products, like the Gemini app and web experience, later this year.We’ve made incredible progress so far with our family of Gemini models, and we’re always striving to advance the state-of-the-art even further. By investing in a relentless production line of innovation, we’re able to explore new ideas at the frontier, while also unlocking the possibility of new and exciting Gemini use cases.Learn more about Gemini and its capabilities.

One such problem is simulating molecules, which is crucial for drug discovery, materials science, and many other fields. In this article, we will explore the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm and how it can be used to simulate molecules using quantum computers.</p> <h2 id="introduction-to-vqe">Introduction to VQE</h2> <p>The Variational Quantum Eigensolver is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm that aims to find the ground state energy of a molecule. The algorithm consists of two main components:</p> <ol> <li>A parameterized quantum circuit (ansatz) that prepares the trial wave function of the molecule.</li> <li>A classical optimizer that varies the parameters of the ansatz to minimize the energy of the molecule.</li> </ol> <p>The VQE algorithm iteratively optimizes the parameters of the ansatz until it converges to the ground state energy of the molecule.</p> <h2 id="simulating-h2-molecule">Simulating H2 Molecule</h2> <p>Let’s start by simulating a simple molecule, H2, using the VQE algorithm. We will use the STO-3G basis set and the PySCF driver to perform the Hartree-Fock calculation.
