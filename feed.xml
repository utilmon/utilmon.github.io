Investments are usually a collection of so-called assets (stock, credits, bonds, derivatives, calls, puts, etc..) and this collection of assets is called a <strong>portfolio</strong>.</p> <p>The goal of portfolio optimization is to minimize risks (financial loss) and maximize returns (financial gain). But this process is not as simple as it may seem. Gaining high returns with little risk is indeed too good to be true. Risks and returns usually have a trade-off relationship which makes optmizing your portfolio a little more complicated. As Dr. Harry Markowitz states in his Modern Portfolio Theory he created in 1952, “risk is an inherrent part of higher reward.”</p> <p><strong>Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)</strong> <br/> An investment theory based on the idea that investors are risk-averse, meaning that when given two portfolios that offer the same expected return they will prefer the less risky one. Investors can construct portfolios to maximize expected return based on a given level of market risk, emphasizing that risk is an inherent part of higher reward. It is one of the most important and influential economic theories dealing with finance and investment. Dr. Harry Markowitz created the modern portfolio theory (MPT) in 1952 and won the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences in 1990 for it. <br/><br/> <strong>Reference:</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory">Modern Portfolio Theory</a></p> <h2 id="1-finding-the-efficient-frontier">1. Finding the efficient frontier</h2> <p>The Modern portfolio theory (MPT) serves as a general framework to determine an ideal portfolio for investors. The MPT is also referred to as mean-variance portfolio theory because it assumes that any investor will choose the optimal portfolio from the set of portfolios that</p> <ul> <li>Maximizes expected return for a given level of risk; and</li> <li>Minimizes risks for a given level of expected returns.</li> </ul> <p>Consider a situation where you have two stocks to choose from: A and B. You can invest your entire wealth in one of these two stocks. Or you can invest 10% in A and 90% in B, or 20% in A and 80% in B, or 70% in A and 30% in B, etc … There is a huge number of possible combinations and this is a simple case when considering two stocks. Imagine the different combinations you have to consider when you have thousands of stocks.</p> <p>The minimum variance frontier shows the minimum variance that can be achieved for a given level of expected return. To construct a minimum-variance frontier of a portfolio:</p> <ul> <li>Use historical data to estimate the mean, variance of each individual stock in the portfolio, and the correlation of each pair of stocks.</li> <li>Use a computer program to find out the weights of all stocks that minimize the portfolio variance for each pre-specified expected return.</li> <li>Calculate the expected returns and variances for all the minimum variance portfolios determined in step 2 and then graph the two variables.</li> </ul> <p>Investors will never want to hold a portfolio below the minimum variance point. They will always get higher returns along the positively sloped part of the minimum-variance frontier. And the positively sloped part of the minimum-variance frontier is called the <strong>efficient frontier</strong>.</p> <p>The <strong>efficient frontier</strong> is where the optimal portfolios are. And it helps narrow down the different portfolios from which the investor may choose.</p> <h2 id="2-goal-of-our-exercise">2. Goal Of Our Exercise</h2> <p>The goal of this exercise is to find the efficent frontier for an inherent risk using a quantum approach. We will use Qiskit’s Finance application modules to convert our portfolio optimization problem into a quadratic program so we can then use variational quantum algorithms such as VQE and QAOA to solve our optimization problem. Let’s first start by looking at the actual problem we have at hand.</p> <h2 id="3-four-stock-portfolio-optimization-problem">3. Four-Stock Portfolio Optimization Problem</h2> <p>Let us consider a portfolio optimization problem where you have a total of four assets (e.g. STOCK0, STOCK1, STOCK2, STOCK3) to choose from. Your goal is to find out a combination of two assets that will minimize the tradeoff between risk and return which is the same as finding the efficient frontier for the given risk.</p> <h2 id="4-formulation">4. Formulation</h2> <p>How can we formulate this problem?<br/> The function which describes the efficient frontier can be formulated into a quadratic program with linear constraints as shown below. <br/> The terms that are marked in red are associated with risks and the terms in blue are associated with returns. You can see that our goal is to minimize the tradeoff between risk and return. In general, the function we want to optimize is called an objective function. <br/> <br/></p> \[\min_{x \in \{0, 1\}^n}: q x^n\Sigma x - \mu ^n x\] \[subject \ to: 1^n x = B\] <ul> <li> <font size="4em">x</font> <p>indicates asset allocation.</p> </li> <li> <font size="4em">Σ</font> <p>(sigma) is a covariance matrix. A covariance matrix is a useful math concept that is widely applied in financial engineering. It is a statistical measure of how two asset prices are varying with respect to each other. When the covariance between two stocks is high, it means that one stock experiences heavy price movements and is volatile if the price of the other stock changes.</p> </li> <li> <font size="4em">q</font> <p>is called a risk factor (risk tolerance), which is an evaluation of an individual’s willingness or ability to take risks. For example, when you use the automated financial advising services, the so-called robo-advising, you will usually see different risk tolerance levels. This q value is the same as such and takes a value between 0 and 1.</p> </li> <li> <font size="4em">𝝁</font> <p>(mu) is the expected return and is something we obviously want to maximize.</p> </li> <li> <font size="4em">n</font> <p>is the number of different assets we can choose from</p> </li> <li> <font size="4em">B</font> <p>stands for Budget. And budget in this context means the number of assets we can allocate in our portfolio.</p> </li> </ul> <h4 id="goal">Goal:</h4> <p>Our goal is to find the <strong>x</strong> value. The x value here indicates which asset to pick (𝑥[𝑖]=1) and which not to pick (𝑥[𝑖]=0).</p> <h4 id="assumptions">Assumptions:</h4> <p>We assume the following simplifications:</p> <ul> <li>all assets have the same price (normalized to 1),</li> <li>the full budget \(B\) has to be spent, i.e. one has to select exactly \(B\) assets.</li> <li>the equality constraint \(1^n x = B\) is mapped to a penalty term \((1^n x - B)^2\) which is scaled by a parameter and subtracted from the objective function.</li> </ul> <h2 id="step-1-import-necessary-libraries">Step 1.

For example, if you allocate twice for STOCK3 and one for STOCK2, then your portfolio can be represented as [2, 1, 0, 0]. If you allocate a single weight for STOCK0, STOCK1, STOCK2 then your portfolio will look like [0, 1, 1, 1].</p> <p>Furthermore, let’s change the constraint to B=3. With this new constraint, find the optimal portfolio that minimizes the tradeoff between risk and return.</p> <p>There are two approaches we can take to handle the double weights:</p> <ol> <li>Use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bounds</code> option in the PortfolioOptimization class to allow integer variables. By default, bounds is set to ‘None’ which means all the variables are binary. But we can set bounds=[[0,2],[0,2],[0,2],[0,2]] to allow any one of the four stocks to have double weights.</li> <li>Repeat the stocks twice in the list and concatenate the expected return and covariance data. For example, you can allocate double weights to one asset by repeating them twice like [STOCKA, STOCKB, STOCKC, STOCKD, <strong>STOCKA</strong>, <strong>STOCKB</strong>, <strong>STOCKC</strong>, <strong>STOCKD</strong>]. This way, even with only binary variables, you can still allocate double weights. You would just need to double the number of assets and concatenate mu and sigma accordingly.</li> </ol> <p>Here is the code using the first approach with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bounds</code> option:</p> <div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">q2</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">0.5</span>     <span class="c1">#Set risk factor to 0.5

In December, we launched our first natively multimodal model Gemini 1.0 in three sizes: Ultra, Pro and Nano. Just a few months later we released 1.5 Pro, with enhanced performance and a breakthrough long context window of 1 million tokens.Developers and enterprise customers have been putting 1.5 Pro to use in incredible ways and finding its long context window, multimodal reasoning capabilities and impressive overall performance incredibly useful.We know from user feedback that some applications need lower latency and a lower cost to serve. This inspired us to keep innovating, so today, we’re introducing Gemini 1.5 Flash: a model that’s lighter-weight than 1.5 Pro, and designed to be fast and efficient to serve at scale.Both 1.5 Pro and 1.5 Flash are available in public preview with a 1 million token context window in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. And now, 1.5 Pro is also available with a 2 million token context window via waitlist to developers using the API and to Google Cloud customers.We’re also introducing updates across the Gemini family of models, announcing our next generation of open models, Gemma 2, and sharing progress on the future of AI assistants, with Project Astra.Context lengths of leading foundation models compared with Gemini 1.5’s 2 million token capability1.5 Flash is the newest addition to the Gemini model family and the fastest Gemini model served in the API. It’s optimized for high-volume, high-frequency tasks at scale, is more cost-efficient to serve and features our breakthrough long context window.While it’s a lighter weight model than 1.5 Pro, it’s highly capable of multimodal reasoning across vast amounts of information and delivers impressive quality for its size.The new Gemini 1.5 Flash model is optimized for speed and efficiency, is highly capable of multimodal reasoning and features our breakthrough long context window.1.5 Flash excels at summarization, chat applications, image and video captioning, data extraction from long documents and tables, and more. This is because it’s been trained by 1.5 Pro through a process called “distillation,” where the most essential knowledge and skills from a larger model are transferred to a smaller, more efficient model.Read more about 1.5 Flash in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report, on the Gemini technology page, and learn about 1.5 Flash’s availability and pricing.Over the last few months, we’ve significantly improved 1.5 Pro, our best model for general performance across a wide range of tasks.Beyond extending its context window to 2 million tokens, we’ve enhanced its code generation, logical reasoning and planning, multi-turn conversation, and audio and image understanding through data and algorithmic advances. We see strong improvements on public and internal benchmarks for each of these tasks.1.5 Pro can now follow increasingly complex and nuanced instructions, including ones that specify product-level behavior involving role, format and style. We’ve improved control over the model’s responses for specific use cases, like crafting the persona and response style of a chat agent or automating workflows through multiple function calls. And we’ve enabled users to steer model behavior by setting system instructions.We added audio understanding in the Gemini API and Google AI Studio, so 1.5 Pro can now reason across image and audio for videos uploaded in Google AI Studio. And we’re now integrating 1.5 Pro into Google products, including Gemini Advanced and in Workspace apps.Read more about 1.5 Pro in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report and on the Gemini technology page.Gemini Nano is expanding beyond text-only inputs to include images as well. Starting with Pixel, applications using Gemini Nano with Multimodality will be able to understand the world the way people do — not just through text, but also through sight, sound and spoken language.Read more about Gemini 1.0 Nano on Android.Today, we’re also sharing a series of updates to Gemma, our family of open models built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models.We’re announcing Gemma 2, our next generation of open models for responsible AI innovation. Gemma 2 has a new architecture designed for breakthrough performance and efficiency, and will be available in new sizes.The Gemma family is also expanding with PaliGemma, our first vision-language model inspired by PaLI-3. And we’ve upgraded our Responsible Generative AI Toolkit with LLM Comparator for evaluating the quality of model responses.Read more on the Developer blog.As part of Google DeepMind’s mission to build AI responsibly to benefit humanity, we’ve always wanted to develop universal AI agents that can be helpful in everyday life. That’s why today, we’re sharing our progress in building the future of AI assistants with Project Astra (advanced seeing and talking responsive agent).To be truly useful, an agent needs to understand and respond to the complex and dynamic world just like people do — and take in and remember what it sees and hears to understand context and take action. It also needs to be proactive, teachable and personal, so users can talk to it naturally and without lag or delay.While we’ve made incredible progress developing AI systems that can understand multimodal information, getting response time down to something conversational is a difficult engineering challenge. Over the past few years, we’ve been working to improve how our models perceive, reason and converse to make the pace and quality of interaction feel more natural.Building on Gemini, we’ve developed prototype agents that can process information faster by continuously encoding video frames, combining the video and speech input into a timeline of events, and caching this information for efficient recall.By leveraging our leading speech models, we also enhanced how they sound, giving the agents a wider range of intonations. These agents can better understand the context they’re being used in, and respond quickly, in conversation.With technology like this, it’s easy to envision a future where people could have an expert AI assistant by their side, through a phone or glasses. And some of these capabilities are coming to Google products, like the Gemini app and web experience, later this year.We’ve made incredible progress so far with our family of Gemini models, and we’re always striving to advance the state-of-the-art even further. By investing in a relentless production line of innovation, we’re able to explore new ideas at the frontier, while also unlocking the possibility of new and exciting Gemini use cases.Learn more about Gemini and its capabilities.

While error correction is the ultimate goal to completely negate the effects of noise, it requires a huge overhead of both quantum and classical resources, making it impractical in the current NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) era. Instead, we can focus on reducing the effects of noise using techniques called error mitigation and error suppression, which aim to reduce hardware errors with a much smaller overhead.</p> <h2 id="error-mitigation-with-measurement-error-mitigation-m3">Error Mitigation with Measurement Error Mitigation (M3)</h2> <p>Measurement errors over \(N\) qubits can be treated classically and satisfy the equation:</p> \[\vec{p}_{noisy} = A\vec{p}_{ideal}\] <p>where \(\vec{p}*{noisy}\) is a vector of noisy probabilities returned by the quantum system, \(\vec{p}*{ideal}\) is the probabilities in the absence of measurement errors, and \(A\_{row,col}\) is the \(2^N \times 2^N\) complete assignment matrix, where each element in \(A\) is the probability of bit string \(col\) being converted to bit string \(row\) by the measurement-error process.</p> <p>M3 is a scalable quantum measurement error mitigation package that works in a reduced subspace defined by the noisy input bitstrings that are to be corrected. It solves the linear equation:</p> \[(\tilde{A})^{-1}\tilde{A}\vec{p}_{ideal} = (\tilde{A})^{-1}\vec{p}_{noisy}\] <p>This linear equation can often be solved trivially using LU decomposition with modest computing resources. However, if the number of unique bitstrings is large or memory constraints are tight, the problem can be solved in a matrix-free manner using preconditioned iterative linear solution methods like GMRES or BiCGSTAB.</p> <h2 id="error-suppression-with-dynamic-decoupling-dd">Error Suppression with Dynamic Decoupling (DD)</h2> <p>Dynamic decoupling (DD) is used to increase the lifetime of quantum information by effectively disconnecting the environment. It scans the circuit for idle periods of time and inserts a DD sequence of gates in those spots. These gates amount to the identity, so they do not alter the logical action of the circuit but have the effect of mitigating decoherence in those idle periods.</p> <p>It is important to have an optimal decoupling sequence that does not destroy qubit coherence instead of preserving it. Applying an X-gate twice is equal to an identity gate, so there is no logical change to the circuit.</p> <h2 id="error-mitigation-with-twirled-readout-error-extinction-t-rex">Error Mitigation with Twirled Readout Error eXtinction (T-REX)</h2> <p>T-REX involves “twirling” of gates, where noise is viewed as a set of extra probabilistic gates on top of the perfect circuit implementation. Every time the circuit is executed, this noisy gate set is conjugated with a gate randomly chosen from a “twirling set”, often a set of Pauli operators (Pauli twirling).</p> <p>Pauli twirling inserts pairs of Pauli gates (I, X, Y, Z) before and after entangling gates such that the overall unitary is the same, but implemented differently. This turns coherent errors into stochastic errors, which can then be eliminated by sufficient averaging.</p> <h2 id="digital-zero-noise-extrapolation-zne">Digital Zero Noise Extrapolation (ZNE)</h2> <p>Digital Zero Noise Extrapolation (ZNE) is a technique for mitigating errors without the need for additional quantum resources. A quantum program is altered to run at different effect levels of processor noise, and the result is extrapolated to an estimated value at a noiseless level.</p> <p>There are two methods for scaling noise in ZNE:</p> <ol> <li>Pulse stretching (analog): Applying the same pulse stretched along a larger amount of time for a circuit, increasing the effective noise.</li> <li>Local/Global folding (digital): Compiling the input circuit with a larger number of gates. Each gate \(G\) is replaced by \(G\), \(G^\dagger\), \(G\). On a simulator, the circuit remains unchanged, but on a real device, the noise increases.</li> </ol> <p>ZNE amplifies the scale factor of noise to estimate the measured value in the absence of noise. However, it is not guaranteed to mitigate all errors.</p> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>Error mitigation and suppression techniques like M3, DD, T-REX, and ZNE are crucial for reducing the effects of noise in the current NISQ era of quantum computing. While not as comprehensive as error correction, these methods provide a more practical approach to improving the quality of information obtained from quantum computers. As research in this field progresses, we can expect further advancements in error mitigation and suppression techniques, bringing us closer to the goal of fault-tolerant quantum computing.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Quantum-Computing"/><category term="physics"/><category term="programming"/><category term="code"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Introduction to Error Mitigation and Error Suppression in Quantum Computing]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Displaying External Posts on Your al-folio Blog</title><link href="https://utilmon.github.io/blog/2022/displaying-external-posts-on-your-al-folio-blog/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Displaying External Posts on Your al-folio Blog"/><published>2022-04-23T23:20:09+00:00</published><updated>2022-04-23T23:20:09+00:00</updated><id>https://utilmon.github.io/blog/2022/displaying-external-posts-on-your-al-folio-blog</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://utilmon.github.io/blog/2022/displaying-external-posts-on-your-al-folio-blog/"><![CDATA[<h3>External Posts on Your al-folio Blog</h3> <p>If you prefer publishing blog posts on medium.com or other external sources, starting version v0.5.0, <a href="https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio">al-folio</a> lets you to display your external posts in the blog feed of your website! 🎉🎉</p> <p>Configuring external sources of super simple.
